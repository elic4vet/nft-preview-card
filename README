## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned more about flexbox and grid. I also learned how to use styled components. I also learned how to use the :hover pseudo class and how to use the transform property.

```css
.view {
  transition: 0.5s ease;
  opacity: 0;
  position: absolute;
  top: 35%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  -ms-transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  text-align: center;
  color: var(--white);
  margin-top: 20px;
```

```css
.overlay {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: cyan;
  opacity: 0;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue to learn more about flexbox and grid. I will also learn more about styled components. I will also learn more about the transform property.
